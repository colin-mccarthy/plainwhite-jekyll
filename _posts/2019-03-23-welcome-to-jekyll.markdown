Many Engineers I talk to are facing an request to move their apps and infrastructure to a particular cloud provider. They are often asking me about going fully GCP native or fully Azure native. A lot of the time they may have already gone down this path before with another clouf=d provider and are being asked to move now. They may have gone all in with AWS a year or two ago and now they need to move away from Amazon. This is a comman trend I'm hearing all the time.
